##### Movies-ETL
A ton of Wikipedia data about movies, plus budgets and box offices returns, cast, crew, production and much more. Fortunately one of Britta's workmate created a script to go through a list of movies and Wikipedia for the 90's to 2018 and able to extract information into JSON. Because their workmate couldn't find the script but the JSON file, we'll have to imput JSON file into pandas.
